This blog contains musings on pharmacometrics, modeling & simulation, drug development, software engineering, and other random topics. The title of this blog is an attempt to reflect the unassuming nature of the blog posts penned down here. While my blogs *may* sound opiniated on some topics, I always try to keep an open mind to new modeling & simulation approaches, innovative drug treatments (sorry, homeopathy is not one of them...), and life in general. My brain is in continuous MCMC mode so please present me with evidence of the contrary if you do not agree with me and I'll update my posteriors :)

Many tools I talk about here are available through my [Github repo](https://github.com/ronkeizer) or from [Pirana Software](http://www.pirana-software.com).
