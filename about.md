Musings on pharmacometrics, drug treatment optimization, modeling & simulation, software engineering, and other random geeky topics I find interesting. The title of this blog attempts to capture it's unassuming nature: I keep an open mind to new views, new modeling approaches, new software tools, innovative drug treatments (sorry, homeopathy is not one of them...), etc. I'm trying to keep my brain in continuous MCMC mode so - if you do not agree with me - present me with evidence of the contrary and my posteriors might be updated :)

Many tools I talk about here are available through my [Github repo](https://github.com/ronkeizer) or from [Pirana Software](http://www.pirana-software.com).
