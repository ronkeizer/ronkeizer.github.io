I am a pharmacometrician and software engineer working in San
Francisco (at UCSF and two startups). What you'll find here are
musings on pharmacometrics, applied statistics, software engineering,
and other random geeky topics I find interesting. The title of this
blog attempts to capture it's unassuming nature and my attempt to keep
an open mind to new science and technology.

_So... why a blog, exactly?_

- I like writing, and '_practice makes perfect_', or in my case probably '_slightly worse_' (but that doesn't alliterate well)
- Writing a blog is much more fun that writing journal articles.
- I belief that many blogs (e.g. [this one](http://andrewgelman.com/), and [this one](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/)) have more direct and wide-spread impact on science than journal articles written by the same authors. Maybe not in a classical, high impact factor, peer-reviewed, _get's-you-tenure_ kind of way, but more in an actual real-world sense. (Needless to say I wouldn't dare compare this blog to those linked above).
- I can't cram my thoughts in 140 characters, sorry.
