I am a pharmacometrician and software engineer working in San Francisco (at UCSF and two startups). What you'll find here are musings on pharmacometrics, applied statistics, software engineering, and other random geeky topics I find interesting. The title of this blog attempts to capture it's unassuming nature and my attempt to keep an open mind. If you do not agree with me just present me with evidence of the contrary and my posteriors might be updated ;)

Many tools I talk about here are available at my [Github repositories](https://github.com/ronkeizer), at [Pirana Software](http://www.pirana-software.com), or at [InsightRX](http://www.insight-rx.com).
