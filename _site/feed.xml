        <title>Finally... the Word-free manuscript workflow?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I have used Microsoft Word® for 20 years or so, it always
frustrated the hell out of me, and apparently I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/I-Hate-Microsoft-Word/237942199602618&quot;&gt;not the only
one&lt;/a&gt;. The extreme bugginess (anyone ever managed to create a stable
document longer than 50 pages?), the difficult formatting, the ugly
equations, the annoying theming features, the proprietary file format
(only partially solved with &lt;em&gt;.docx&lt;/em&gt;), and so on. Why it is perfectly
fine for writing a letter, for writing research papers it is pretty
far from ideal. Obviously I have been continuosly looking around for
alternatives for writing manuscripts, but the real &lt;em&gt;Word-free&lt;/em&gt;
workflow has so far eluded me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wordhttpronkeizergithubioassetswordjpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ronkeizer.github.io//assets/word.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Word&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/strong&gt; is a potential alternative to Word, and it is a fairly
nice product (and free), but its main drawback is that it is not fully
compatible with Word. Especially its review functionality (showing
notes, deletions, additions, etc) is not compatible. And that is the
most important functionality when writing a research
paper in collaboration with Word-users…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LaTeX&lt;/strong&gt; is another obvious alternative. It actually has many
advantages over Word: it is text-based (so no file degradation and easy version
control), has beautiful typesetting, nice-looking equations, easy
compilation to PDF, etc. For many manuals and reports that
did not require collaboration I have used LaTeX a lot, and (learned to) love
it. However, I work in a research field that is only partially made up
of engineers, and LaTeX’s steep learning curve is not something that
excites many of my collaborators. Which is no critique of them, I can
easily see that LaTeX can be more frustrating than
Word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, &lt;strong&gt;RStudio&lt;/strong&gt; has evolved into the
indispensible IDE for R, and by offering support for &lt;strong&gt;markdown&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;knitr&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;pandoc&lt;/strong&gt; it offers a great workflow for creating PDF
manuscripts, and in a fully reproducible way too. Citations can be
added fairly easily using BibTex (although it would be nice to have a
simple reference manager in RStudio?). An almost perfect solution, one
is inclined to think, but not yet a full alternative to Word, since
the resulting manuscript (PDF) still has to be shared with
co-authors. This is less than perfect since some collaborators are
likely to have problems making notes and edits in PDF documents, and
any edits still have to be re-entered manually into the source document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual workflow over the last few years has often been to start
drafting research papers in &lt;strong&gt;Google Docs&lt;/strong&gt;, and move to Word (or RStudio)
when the time comes to add references and share the manuscript with
co-authors. It has been mostly the lack of a reference manager in Google
Docs that made it impractible to use for anything more complex than a
conference abstract. So - until recently - this was not a viable
alternative for research manuscripts either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So the perfect, ‘Word-free’ workflow does not exist?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would almost give up hope, but two recent new tools could turn out
to be game-changers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RStudio and pandoc&lt;/strong&gt; as of recently also support the &lt;em&gt;knitting&lt;/em&gt;
of R-markdown documents straight to Word. This way you can keep your
co-authors happy by providing a Word document instead of PDF that they
can more easily edit. The only remaining hurdle with this workflow is
that collaborators’ edits and comments still need to be entered into
the source document (unless the source document itself is
shared). Officially, we can’t call this a &lt;em&gt;‘Word-free’&lt;/em&gt; workflow, but at
least we don’t have to actively write the document in Word, and we’ll be
able to enjoy a frustration-free workday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the new reference manager &lt;strong&gt;Paperpile&lt;/strong&gt;. On the surface, Paperpile
seems yet another reference manager, much like the already pretty
awesome Mendeley and Zotero. The latter two products were vast
improvements over the more ‘corporate’ (EndNote) or ‘buggy’ (Reference
Manager) tools that were in use when I was in grad school. However,
there is one extremely interesting aspect to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperpile.com/app&quot;&gt;Paperpile&lt;/a&gt;, and that is that it is able to
cite articles from inside Google Docs. Therebey it basically removes Word
from the equation! Needless to say, collaboration features are
engrained into Google Docs, and even less tech-savvy collaborators
will likeley be able to open a Google Doc and edit, right? When it is time to
submit the paper to a journal, you’ll still have to save to Word, but
this is probably as good as it gets at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two developments are great news. Google Docs is probably a more
pleasing writing environment than RStudio, while the advantage of
RStudio is that manuscripts are created in a reproducible workflow. So
I’ll still be using both tools, probably. The only thing left is for
someone to integrate RStudio Server into Google Docs in some way, and
we’ll have the perfect collaborative cloud-based manuscript writing workflow…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Bayesian Christmas Carol</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Christmas everybody! Thought it’d be nice to share the famous Christmas carol from George E.P. Box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s no Theorem like Bayes Theorem&lt;br /&gt;
Like no theorem we know&lt;br /&gt;
Everything about it is appealing&lt;br /&gt;
Everything about it is a wow&lt;br /&gt;
Let out that a priori feeling&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve been concealing up to now.&lt;br /&gt;
… There’s no Theorem like Bayes Theorem&lt;br /&gt;
Like no Theorem we know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.it/books?id=_Kx5xVGuLRIC&amp;amp;pg=PA132&amp;amp;lpg=PA132&amp;amp;dq=there+no+theorem+like+bayes+theorem&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=LZUvA3VRCb&amp;amp;sig=L8KMZlWRhW2r3Y4yL23mLRyEQEo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=-Z2RVLLUHMyMaKPOgaAN&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=there%20no%20theorem%20like%20bayes%20theorem&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;this great book&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you get inspired this X-mas (or bored out of your wits), have a look at this great collection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~brad/V9SingAlong.pdf&quot;&gt;Bayes-inspired songs&lt;/a&gt;, it has the full text to &lt;em&gt;There’s no Theorem like Bayes Theorem&lt;/em&gt; too…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Best books of 2014</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ronkeizer.github.io//assets/books.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;books&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Bill Gates shared his list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2014&quot;&gt;best books of 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which stimulated me to think about the best books I read this year. Unfortunately, recent fatherhood has kept me away from a lot of books I planned to read this year, but I did manage to squeeze in a couple of very interesting ones. These are my 5-star books from 2014:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The boys in the Boat&lt;/strong&gt; (Daniel James Brown): very powerful narrative about the 1936 US Olympic rowing team, a collection of working-class students from the Washington state that conquered the world in Nazi-Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countdown to zero day&lt;/strong&gt; (Kim Zetter): The thrilling tale of the the Stuxnet virus, the first (known) cyberwarfare weapon that took down an Iranian nuclear plant. It also explains why we should be much more vigilant about securing our public utilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool Gray City of Love&lt;/strong&gt; (Gary Kamiya): An engaging book about San Francisco’s short but exciting history. In 49 short stories the author visits places in and around SF to tell their history.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero to One&lt;/strong&gt;: About technological advance, entrepeneurship, and how the world works in general. Peter Thiel’s book transcends most other books written by Silicon Valley VCs (like &lt;strong&gt;The Hard Thing about Hard Things&lt;/strong&gt; from Ben Horowitz, also released this year and an interesting read) due to its more philosophic nature. The book is short, so I plan to re-read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disappointments&quot;&gt;Disappointments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I was looking forward a lot to the release of &lt;strong&gt;the Bone Clocks&lt;/strong&gt;, the new book by David Mitchell (author of Cloud Atlas). I’m sad to say it disappointed me a lot. Althought the narrative and dialogue was strong as ever, the story really fell apart somewhere in Chapter 5 where it got lost in some holistic science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. A pity, because Cloud Atlas was awesome…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A book by another favorite author disappointed me too: &lt;strong&gt;the Circle&lt;/strong&gt;, by David Eggers is written around a very relevant theme and promised to be the &lt;strong&gt;1984&lt;/strong&gt; of our generation. Although it did stir up much-needed discussions about online privacy, I think it stretched beyond belief Silicon Valley’s tendency to disregard privacy and glorify technological advance. Not a bad read overall, but over-the-top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please drop any suggestions you have in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Upgrading NONMEM to Yosemite</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple released their new OS (Yosemite) a few weeks ago. Unfortunately upgrading to the new system breaks the installation of NONMEM, PsN, and Pirana. Here’s what I did to get up and running again. Altogether this should take less than 20 minutes. &lt;em&gt;Please note that I cannot be held liable for any damage caused directly or indirectly by following the advice below!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: You need to re-install gcc/gfortran. You can install from source, or from e.g. HomeBrew, but I just chose to take the binaries from &lt;a href=&quot;http://hpc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; which had just updated their versions. Download gcc and gfortran for Yosemite. Then in the console run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/Downloads
sudo tar -xvf gcc-5.0-bin.tar -C /
sudo tar -xvf gfortran-5.0-bin.tar -C /&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Re-install the Apple developer tools for Yosemite. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and install the ones for OSX 10.10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Now you are ready to re-install NONMEM. I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /Users/ronkeizer/Dropbox/Software/NONMEM/nm730CD_essential
sudo /bin/bash SETUP73 /Users/ronkeizer/Dropbox/Software/NONMEM/nm730CD_essential /opt/NONMEM/nm73g gfortran y ar same rec i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(But change the source and target folders to your own of course!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t forget to update psn.conf if you installed to a new location. Use e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo nano /Library/Perl/5.16/PsN_4_2_0/psn.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to edit the system-wide configuration file or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;nano ~/psn.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you have a personal psn.conf file. Also, you might need to re-install some Perl modules for PsN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo cpan -i Math::Random
sudo cpan -i Statistics::Distributions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt;: To make Pirana work again, the only thing you need to do is re-install XQuartz, download &lt;a href=&quot;http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all, folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-jan-7th-2015&quot;&gt;Update Jan 7th 2015&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If after upgrading you encounter the following error when running a model with PsN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;Pirana: starting execute on run10.mod
dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/libperl.dylib
Referenced from: /usr/bin/perl5.18
Reason: Incompatible library version: perl5.18 requires version 5.18.0 or later, but libperl.dylib provides version 5.16.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Pirana go to &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; –&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Environment variables&lt;/em&gt; –&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Set other environment variables&lt;/em&gt;.
Add in this text-box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should basically clear this variable from the environment, and PsN should run without errors again.&lt;/p&gt;
