Happy Christmas everybody! Thought it'd be nice to share the famous Christmas carol from George E.P. Box:

> There's no Theorem like Bayes Theorem<br>
> Like no theorem we know<br>
> Everything about it is appealing<br>
> Everything about it is a wow<br>
> Let out that a priori feeling<br>
> You've been concealing up to now.<br>
> ... There's no Theorem like Bayes Theorem<br>
> Like no Theorem we know.<br>

(Taken from [this great book](https://books.google.it/books?id=_Kx5xVGuLRIC&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=there+no+theorem+like+bayes+theorem&source=bl&ots=LZUvA3VRCb&sig=L8KMZlWRhW2r3Y4yL23mLRyEQEo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-Z2RVLLUHMyMaKPOgaAN&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=there%20no%20theorem%20like%20bayes%20theorem&f=false).)

And if you get inspired this X-mas (or bored out of your wits), have a look at this great collection of [Bayes-inspired songs](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~brad/V9SingAlong.pdf), it has the full text to _There's no Theorem like Bayes Theorem_ too...
